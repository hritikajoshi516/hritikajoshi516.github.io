Hi, Hritika Joshi here! Welcome to my vortex. Watch me spiral.

Having completed my Master's degree in Globalization and Sustainable Development recently, I am now hungry for an opportunity to do impactful work. I completed my Master's thesis on the migration motivations and adaptation strategies of Nepali students who migrate to the Global South. The idea was inspired by my own experiences as an International student (more on that on the 'rants' page), and learning about the similar yet contrasting experiences of other students was enriching, to say the least.
I have worked professionally in the project management and research sector back in Nepal, and I hope to hone my skills further in Europe. 

I worked as a Research Officer at Rooster Logic (if you want to know more about this peculiar name, all you need to do is call me for an interview, and I will tell you), a research and IT firm in Nepal, for over two years. This was my longest employment and the most insightful one. Broadly, I worked on research-based development projects in collaboration with various INGOs and development organizations. I wore multiple hats in this position- led projects, managed clients, collected data, analyzed data, wrote reports, conducted orientations, participated in field assignments, and much more. Almost all of my professional commitments have been like that. I was hired in a specific position, but I ended up doing many things. Wearing all these multiple hats was a huge learning opportunity and gave me space for creativity and growth. 

Because I have worked on many things, I have become sort of a 'jack of all trades, master of some'. I do not think it is necessarily a bad thing. I see it as an opportunity to delve into so many things and offer multiple skill sets to any organization. However, I struggle to 'sell myself' in the job market for precisely the same reason. I have worked on multiple things and probably have 'generic' skill sets, so I cannot impress employers looking for specific skill sets. 

Hence, I am here. I plan to use this space to say things how I want to, not limited by word count or the need to impress. Therefore, in case it was not clear, I am petty, desperate, and looking for a freaking job!!

And as I mentioned earlier, subscribe to me once and you will get multiple features. Isn't that a good deal?
