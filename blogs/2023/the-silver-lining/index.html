Even though I always tried to be kind to people around me, I did not realize the impact it could have on others until very recently. Just a kind gesture from a stranger or a small help from a colleague can make our day infinitely better.</p> <p>The past eight months have been pretty difficult for me emotionally. I have been struggling to find a job (which is pretty much the whole theme of this website lol) and stressing over what my next steps could/should be. While I am going through this turmoil, there have been people who have made my life a little better. Many of them did not know even know that I was struggling. They were kind to me not out of sympathy but because that is who they are. They are just good people. I want to appreciate them here. I want to remind myself of how grateful I am to them.</p> <p>While looking for a job related to my academic background, I joined a hostel as a housekeeper. I took the job because I needed the money. That was it. I did not give it any more thought. However, after working there for seven months now, I can say that the job went beyond just a way to make ends meet.</p> <p>Housekeeping is a stressful job. There is too much to do and too little time on some days. It is very physical, and one has to work fast. I am not that fast, at least not as fast as some of my colleagues. Whenever I could not keep up despite trying my best, they were there to help. They never made me feel like I was at fault. Every colleague at the hostel has been nothing but kind through these months. They have treated me like their own. They have helped me whenever I needed them, always offered me whatever snack they had, and made me laugh countless times. The gestures might look small, but the hearts behind them were huge.</p> <p>On the other hand, I am surprised and glad they could see me beyond my social awkwardness. I can get a bit reluctant to speak to new people, and this often comes out as me being rude. I believe they understood this side of me. We have sat in silence, on our phones, or just staring into the wall, and none of us felt the need to fill the silence.</p> <p>Do not get me wrong. We talk and laugh. We make jokes too. It is just that we have been able to enjoy the comfort of silence too.</p> <p>This experience only got better because of my supervisors at the hostel. The journey would not be this smooth if the supervisors had not been pleasant. I work mainly with two supervisors, both of whom are polar opposites. As cliché as it sounds, one of them is like a coconut. He looks serious from the outside and wants everything to be perfect. However he is always kind and supportive.</p> <p>And the second supervisor is my favorite. Her presence at work makes my day better. To know that someone is there willing to take care of you is such a blessing. She is that person. She will always have a smile on her face and keeps an open mind. I can tell her about any problem at work, and she will be ready to help. What more could I ask for?</p> <p>I have been lucky to find a workplace that has been a silver lining in my otherwise not-so-fun life. I wonder how difficult it would have been for me if I was stuck at a job I did not like and with people I could not connect to. I have probably not been able to directly express how grateful I am to all of them, but I am glad I am putting it down here at the least.</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Hritika Joshi. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.6/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-EdPgYcPk/IIrw7FYeuJQexva49pVRZNmt3LculEr7zM=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-SF9RCXN0GV"></script> <script>function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-SF9RCXN0GV");</script><script async type="text/javascript">!function(e,t,a,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=t.createElement(a),s=t.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","","auto"),ga("send","pageview");</script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
