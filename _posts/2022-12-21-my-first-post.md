I am from Nepal. In case you are unaware, it is the land of Mount Everest. If you do not know what Mouth Everest is, it is the tallest mountain in the world. If you do not know what a mountain is, Google says it is a large elevation of the earth's surface rising 'abruptly' from the surrounding level.

Okay! okay! okay! back to the point (as if there was any)- I moved to Norway over two years ago and Boy Oh Boy! it has been quite a ride. Being born and brought up in Nepal, Norway has been quite an interesting experience. The contrasts and similarities between both cultures are quite fascinating. However, my Norway stories deserve a separate piece so more on that later.

I come from a small town in Nepal. I was born and brought up inâ€¦

Okay, I am struggling to write this piece. My thoughts are all over the place. But guess what? My website, my rules so I will complete this later.

But, here are three things about me that are on top of my mind now:

1.	I love love love my family.They mean everything to me.
2.	I am quite lazy.
3.	I dream too much. 
4.	I like sharing stories- all kinds, all the time.
