Want to hear something funny? 

Until December 2020, I thought moving to Norway will change my life.

Until April 2021, I thought I was smart.

Until June 2021, I thought I was good at physical work.

Until October 2021, I thought I will be financially stable soon.

Until December 2021, I thought I will have a job by the time I graduate.

Until March 2022, I thought I was a strong independent woman.

Until July 2022, I thought I had some potential.

Until October 2022, I thought I will figure something out.

In February 2023, all I am is a moody lump of flesh.
