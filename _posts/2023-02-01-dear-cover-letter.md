Subject: Application to show some mercy

Dear Cover Letter,

With no excitement, I am writing to you to express my annoyance at you for constantly making me feel like a failure. Having completed my Master's degree and gathered some skill sets along the way, I remain unemployed, and I thank you for it. 

Every week, I come across new nuggets of information. 'Your cover letter should not be longer than one page, but you should be able to tell an impressive story and stand out from hundreds of applicants.' 'Your cover letter should be quirky and fun.' 'Follow the standard cover letter format. Experimenting with it might backfire.' 'Customize your cover letter for each job application.' 'Do your research on each employer you are applying to. No! Going through their homepage does not count; you must go seven tabs deep and align your application to the info there. No! No one cares that you apply to multiple jobs every day, and your brain just breaks after a point.' I am confused cover letter. I am so dizzy and so tired.

You are not the only one I am mad at, though. Your partner in crime CV/Resume does not help either. Yes, I still get confused between CV and resume, and I am unsure which one I have. I am tired of hearing things like, 'Your CV should not be longer than one page. A recruiter looks at a CV only for seven seconds.' 'Some recruiters have the ATS software, which filters out CVs, so you need to have an ATS-friendly CV.' And as if this was not excruciating enough, every vacancy will require a long form to be filled with customized answers. And the worst thing, you ask? Having to insert the information already in your CV to that customized form they have.

Well, before you say, I know it is not easy for recruiters. I am getting flashes of recruiters with long posts on LinkedIn explaining how difficult it is to get through hundreds of applications. So, I must reiterate; I am not taking away from their experiences. As a graduate applying to jobs almost every day for the past six months and not receiving any positive response (none whatsoever), it has not been fun on this side either.

Hence, I kindly request you to work in my favor for once. While this letter provides a glimpse into my annoyances, there is considerably more to share, and I look forward to ranting further.
Not looking forward to any more rejections.

Sincerely,

An average candidate seeking job in the current market
